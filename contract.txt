Summary: 

{{company_name}}, located at {{company_address}} are hiring {{name}} located at {{address}} to provide development services including but not limited to troubleshooting and maintenance of software systems. 

What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You'll give me everything I need to complete the project as and when and in the format I need it. 

*Us:* I have the experience and ability to troubleshoot the issues that you are having. I also have the ability to develop new solutions to your business problems. Because time estimation is difficult for software projects I have found it best to bill hourly, in small blocks of time and renew the contract as needed by the purchase of new blocks of time. This minimizes risk for both of parties.

Legal stuff:

I can't guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 
Copyrights:

You will own all the intellectual property rights to all of the work that I do for you.

I love to show off my work and share what I've learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

Payments: 

Payment is due up front before work is begun. Work can be purchased in any number of 40 hour blocks @ $125 per hour. As soon as payment is received work will commence. Time will be tracked very carefully. Risk is kept minimal, and I have every incentive to impress you so that we can renew our contract for another block of time.

Just like a parking ticket, you can't transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed explicitly. Payment for further blocks of time will count as renewal of this agreement. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of {{county}} County and {{state}} State courts.
